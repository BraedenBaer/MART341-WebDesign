Typography is the style and appearance of written language to make it legible.
When a display system encounters a character that is not part of its memory of the fonts used so a fall back font is used instead.
For starters web fonts are not installed on every operating system and or device, system fonts have already been installed on your system by default, web safe fonts are fonts that adapt to any browser on any device.
