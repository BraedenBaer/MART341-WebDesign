            <h2>
              Directions
            </h2>

            <ol>
              <li><p>Preheat the burner on the oven to <b>5 or 6</b> wait 7 minutes and slowly pour the cups of
                olive oil into the cast iron frying pan</li></p>
              <li><p>While the oil gets hot prepare the other ingredients. First pour the panko onto a
                a plate or bowl then add the garlic salt and black pepper. Mix these ingredients together with
                a spoon or by hand, <i>Make sure that you hands are washed.</i></p>
              <li><p>Take the 2 eggs and wisk them in a bowl, after the egg yolks are all mixed take the chicken toughs and
                dip them into the eggs. Then dip the chicken into the panko. This will allow the panko to stick to the chicken.</p>
              <li><p>Now it's time to place the chicken into the frying pan, <b>BE CAREFUL WITH THE OIL IT WILL SIZZLE AND POP.</b>
              <li>Let the chicken cook for about 15 minutes be sure to flip with a fork often so that the chicken is browned
                on both sides.</li></p>
              <li><p>After 15 or so minutes take the chicken off the frying pan and set aside to cool.</li></p>
              <li><p>Finally, you can add what ever ingredients you like for the sandwich and ENJOY!</li></p>
