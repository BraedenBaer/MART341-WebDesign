Out of the numerous forms I came across while browsing the web, the one I came across the most was on Google. This is
really the form to every other form on the internet. For example i pretty much use Google every day and every time I look up something, the text box drops down options to search and i can look up anything I want. The purpose of forms is to collect data and information from users on websites.
