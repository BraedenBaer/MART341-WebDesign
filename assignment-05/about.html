          Although Dark Souls in my opinion has the best story for any video game ever. Many people don't play
          as it has a reputation for being the hardest game series ever. However, the game doesn't rely on a syetem
          where the bosses are hard to kill for no reason, but is set up where you HAVE to learn how enemys
          move and attack to defeat them and progress through the game.
