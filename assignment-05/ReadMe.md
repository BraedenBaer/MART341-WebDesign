In the Wayback Machine, I looked up what YouTube looked like back in 2009. The overall layout is the same more or less,
yet the actual way it looks now and how it is used today is so different from back in 2009. YouTube in 2009 was mostly
made up of short videos and memes like the sneezing panda. But today, YouTube has information almost about anything
which is  crazy because I actually remember when YouTube first came out as an website for  music only. Its just nuts
to me how quickly this like this change and how used we get to how things are now.
