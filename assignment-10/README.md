1.) Universal selector matches elements of any type, while element selects all the elements with a tag name and
can apply the same style to each of the elements with said tag name. Class matches all the elements based  on the contents of their specific class attribute. ID acts similarly as class but uses the attribute from the HTML element to select one unique element.

2.) I choose my colors based off of the image I followed of Bloodborne. I like video games.
