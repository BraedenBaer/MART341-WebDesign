<h1>
  Hunters of Beasts
</h1>

<p>
 With the Scourge of the Beasts now known to all, the Healing Church retreated to the upper edge of Yharnam known as
 the Cathedral Ward and walled of the rest of Yharnam. The church dismantled the old workshop and started a new workshop
 lead by Ludwig a former apprentice of Gehrman with new hunters garbed in black and white.
</p>

<p>
 Most of the black church hunters were elementary doctors who understand the importance of early prevention of the
 scourge, acheived by disposing of victims, and even potential victims, before signs of the sickness manifest
 themselves. The white church hunters where specialist in experimentally-backed blood ministration and how the Scourge
 spread. The believe that medicine is not a means of treatment but ratjer a method of research. They often allowed
 people to turn as a way to study the scourges effects. Nighly Ludwig along with his hunters and the populus of Yharnam
 would cross the Great Bridge separating the Cathral Ward and the rest of Yharnam to fight back against the beasts.
 This formed a us verus them mentality for the people of Yharnam taking blame away from the Church for starting the
 scourge.
